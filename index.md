Hi, welcome to my website! 

I'm David. I'm a Engineer-in-Training currently based in Vancouver, Canada. My passion 
and focus is into the intersection between renewable energy engineering and software 
engineering. I am also very interested in energy, social, and ecological policy and how 
net-zero emissions can be achieved. Perhaps having such a wide focus isn't really a focus,
but I've always enjoyed searching for the big picture.

I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia(second largest metro area in the world!). 
I went to Canada in 2017 to pursue higher education, and in 2022 I graduated from the 
University of British Columbia, with a BASc in Engineering Physics. My studies revolved 
around embedded systems, mechatronics, software design, mathematics, and physics. I was, 
until very recently, working as a Renewable Energy Analyst/Software Developer in Vancouver. 
Now I am working on personal projects and various team projects with friends.

On the side, I enjoy playing the violin(still bad at it), the piano(quite rusty), going 
down Wikipedia rabbitholes(very good at it!), quibbling over philosophy with friends(take 
a drink every time <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> comes up), going to gym, running, and hiking.

Here you will find my technical blogs, which will be a compilation of readings and side 
projects that I would like to share. My personal blogs will be a bunch of readings, essays, 
and book reviews. My study notes will be uploaded notes from the things I have studied.

Email me, lets have a chat sometime!
