Hi, welcome to my website!

I'm David. I'm a Engineer-in-Training currently based in Vancouver, Canada. My passion 
and focus is in the intersection between renewable energy engineering and software 
engineering. I am also interested in environmental and energy policy, as well as ecology 
and systems thinking. I believe that insights into intractable problems can be obtained 
from the dialogue between frameworks, persons, and <i>thous</i>.

I am from Jakarta, Indonesia and I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BASc in 
Engineering Physics. My studies revolved around embedded systems, mechatronics, software design, 
mathematics, and physics. I am currently working as a Renewable Energy Analyst/Software Developer 
in Vancouver.

On the side, I enjoy playing the violin, practising the piano, going down Wikipedia rabbitholes, 
reading and discussing literature, going to the gym, running, and hiking.

Here you will find my technical blogs, which will be a compilation of readings and side 
projects that I would like to share. My personal blogs will be a bunch of readings, essays, 
and book reviews. My study notes will be uploaded notes from the things I have studied.

Email me, lets have a chat sometime!
